# Intro

# About

## Name

The name was chosen like such: "spotify" => "despotifier" => "despot".
It symbolizes the main author's personal despise for spotify.

## What it can do now

- Library issue detection
    - Missing metadata
    - Different tags in one folder
    - Different extension tracks in one folder

## Notes

It can allocate a significant amount of RAM if you have a large collection. (~0.5GiB for my ~1.6TiB collection)

* outdated RAM usage info

## History
### 12-05-2023
It was decided to replace recursive tree with a release-based storage
This has several benefits:
1) get rid of recursion (more predictability, no need to transfer lots of data through recursion)
2) higher performance
3) lower memory consumption
4) smaller database size
5) simpler database updates

# TODO

- add telegram-formatted link insertion in tracklist generated by `format_release_string`

## OFFTOP
- [ ] get the target loudness that fits at least 95% of my music, but ideally >99.9%
    - finish the library scanner functionality and use python json
        - sort tracks by loudness, find average for info, test -18 and -23 targets

### Note that there will be a Ukrainian readme-uk.md
